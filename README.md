### ⭐️ I am currently interested in data science (Python), AI, Rust, and Flutter.<br>
🦀 I think **rust** is a modern and excellent language. It combines memory management and performance.<br>
📊 **data/AI** is currently the most important technology and can do many things.<br>
🚀 **flutter** can create front-ends for multiple OSes with a single codebase.

✋ I also can c/c++, C#, Unity, Python, SQL, FastAPI (some HTML, CSS, JS)

⛳︎I'm trying to understand the principles beyond just using libraries.<br>
👾 I truly enjoy developing and want to learn and build many things.

Even if I like computers and have technical skills, in the end I can't follow nature. I want to be someone who does not become conceited.
